# restaurant-page

This is a [project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page) 
from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) where I create a simple 
restaurant page with tabbed browsing in the homepage, to view home page, menu 
page and contact page, all in the homepage (index). The goal of the project was
to use NPM, and Webpack, install plugins, config webpack.config.js, and 
generate all the content of index.html with only JavaScript.
